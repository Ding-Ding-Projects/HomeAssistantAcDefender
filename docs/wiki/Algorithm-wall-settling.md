## The short version

Waits for someone who is still tapping the wall thermostat to stop before correcting.

## What it watches

Recent touches inside the settling window and the room temperature.

## How it decides

With enough recent touches it holds for the base settle seconds plus extra pressure seconds (more touches = longer), measured from the latest touch. A room over the safety band clears it.

## What it changes

Holds the correction until the wall stops changing.

## Safety boundaries

- Uses the real inputs listed above. It does not invent thermostat, weather, usage, or sensor state.
- Changes only the output listed above. Thermostat-affecting work goes through Home Assistant or returns a real error.
- The global AC Defender rules still apply: the website target remains the floor for cooling commands, the worker keeps refreshing real Home Assistant state 24/7, and comfort/safety rules are not bypassed by decorative timing.

## Settings

<ul class="settings-list"><li><code>WallSettlingGuardEnabled</code></li><li><code>WallSettlingMinimumTouches</code></li><li><code>WallSettlingWindowMinutes</code></li><li><code>WallSettlingBaseSeconds</code></li><li><code>WallSettlingPressureExtraSeconds</code></li><li><code>WallSettlingSafetyBandCelsius</code></li></ul>

## Where to see it

- **Defense page:** live card with state, verdict, evidence, and metrics.
- **Guide page:** generated from the same guard catalog entry.
- **Source:** `Guards/GuardCatalog.cs` describes this page; the implementation is coordinated by `Services/DefenderStateStore.cs` and `Services/AcDefenderService.cs`.

## Failure modes

If **Wall Settling** cannot obtain one of its required real inputs, it reports a blocked, held, or unavailable result and leaves the background worker's Home Assistant refresh running. It never fills a missing room reading, audit event, weather sample, usage value, or device state with a simulator value. If a real Home Assistant command is rejected, the user sees the service's actual error and the article's surface remains available for recovery.
## Security considerations

This feature consumes only the configured Home Assistant entity data, local settings, and the audit context named above. Tokens and credentials stay in the server environment; the static documentation site does not collect analytics, transmit search text, or embed third-party assets. Logs and exports should be reviewed before sharing because real entity names and timestamps can identify a household.
## Verification

Verify the shipped behavior at the feature's live page or endpoint, then run the repository's documented build and test commands. Confirm the real-input and real-error paths, keyboard access, reduced-motion behavior, and a 390 px viewport without horizontal overflow. Record the exact commit and workflow result when publishing a release; a static screenshot alone is not proof of a live Home Assistant command.
