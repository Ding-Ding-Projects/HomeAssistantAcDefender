## The short version

Time-of-day target rules, each gated by a weather activation condition.

## What it watches

The active schedule entry for the current day/time and the weather rule.

## How it decides

When the custom schedule is on, the matching rule supplies the target. Weather rules (always, room-above-outdoor, room-below-outdoor, outdoor-above-target, outdoor-below-target) decide whether corrective action is allowed. The defender still reads Home Assistant 24/7 even when a rule blocks correction.

## What it changes

Sets the target and whether corrective action runs.

## Safety boundaries

- Uses the real inputs listed above. It does not invent thermostat, weather, usage, or sensor state.
- Changes only the output listed above. Thermostat-affecting work goes through Home Assistant or returns a real error.
- The global AC Defender rules still apply: the website target remains the floor for cooling commands, the worker keeps refreshing real Home Assistant state 24/7, and comfort/safety rules are not bypassed by decorative timing.

## Settings

<ul class="settings-list"><li><code>ScheduleEnabled</code></li><li><code>WeatherActivationMode</code></li><li><code>(per-rule Days / Start / End / Target / Weather)</code></li></ul>

## Where to see it

- **Defense page:** guide-only reference entry.
- **Guide page:** generated from the same guard catalog entry.
- **Source:** `Guards/GuardCatalog.cs` describes this page; the implementation is coordinated by `Services/DefenderStateStore.cs` and `Services/AcDefenderService.cs`.

## Failure modes

If **Schedule & Weather Rules** cannot obtain one of its required real inputs, it reports a blocked, held, or unavailable result and leaves the background worker's Home Assistant refresh running. It never fills a missing room reading, audit event, weather sample, usage value, or device state with a simulator value. If a real Home Assistant command is rejected, the user sees the service's actual error and the article's surface remains available for recovery.
## Security considerations

This feature consumes only the configured Home Assistant entity data, local settings, and the audit context named above. Tokens and credentials stay in the server environment; the static documentation site does not collect analytics, transmit search text, or embed third-party assets. Logs and exports should be reviewed before sharing because real entity names and timestamps can identify a household.
## Verification

Verify the shipped behavior at the feature's live page or endpoint, then run the repository's documented build and test commands. Confirm the real-input and real-error paths, keyboard access, reduced-motion behavior, and a 390 px viewport without horizontal overflow. Record the exact commit and workflow result when publishing a release; a static screenshot alone is not proof of a live Home Assistant command.
